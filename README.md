# Network Overlays

A library for building network overlays. At minimum it should provide a composition of overlays to provide a webscale pubsub mechanism, similar to Poldercast:

- HyParView for peersampling / scalable membership service
- Vicinity for topic-based clustering
- Rings for data-replication
